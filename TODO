Change regexp infro to say that it is modifing the track names, not filename.

Add option to disable message box

Rip & Encode one track at a time."?
Maybe even better is "maximum uncoded wav's" with a number field as grip has
it (www.nostatic.org/grip).

Good point, however I would prefer the dialog again on a manual query and not after startup or switching a cd.

** Done ** Add the ability to encode files.

Rip and encode only 1 track at a time. (i.e. using audiocd:/ ioslave).
Plugin system for encoders (user friendly things, again use audiocd plugin system)

If possible restart jobs that have failed.

Enhance kdedirs kcontrol config dialog to let users specify global kde temp dir
	Tmp files are stored in $KDEHOME/tmp-$HOST/appname

what to do with to be overwritten files, delete before?
use KDirLister for adding directories in encodefile? (evaluate after next stable)

for 1.3
try to sort out problems with 2 ore more cd drives
    (e.g. when switching between drives a inserted cd is not recognized,
     makes ripping >1 track sense?
     rip parallel from >1 drive)

for now if there are jobs from different drives try to rip them in parallel
what not works is detecting an already inserted cd, so if you switch drives
you have to reinsert the cd.
What is also annoying is that the gui freezes when reading a new cd.
Maybe this can be resolved using Solid/Phonon instead of KCompactDisc.

Also I would like to use directly libcdparanoia for ripping, the problem is that it needs
a callback and I found no way to support parallel ripping with it - but my C knowledge is somewhat limited ;-),
maybe someone has a solution?, else I will use the cdparanoia binary via a KProcess.
