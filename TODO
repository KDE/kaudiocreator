Add flac preset
Global replace regexp?  i.e. reaplce all " " with "_"

TODO.

Make it possible to stop and start encoding jobs:
Save the joblist, so you can quit and continue later

BUG: a cd with several tracks named the same
     changed both the encoder location and the rip location, and it didn't help?
     yet a possible problem. resarch

Possiblity to use "nice" when calling encode jobs.

"Alternate" encoder location configs. Therefore allowing "sampler cds"
to use "<album>/<tracknumber> <artist> - <title>"
and normal cd's to use "<artist>/<album>/<tracknumber> <title>"
the alternate selection could just be a simple checkbox next
to rip selected tracks.

Add audiocd ioslave config to the configure dialog
-Multiple Artists for 1 album.

-Auto replace text dialog (replace X with Y such as " " with "_")

Use same encoding options that audiocd has

Check to see if the encoded binary exists before encoding (which?).

Rip and encode only 1 song at a time. (i.e. what the audioslave does now, but with a gui).

Add the ability to encode files
