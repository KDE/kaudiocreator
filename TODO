BUG? encoding with different genre's
Possiblity to use "nice" when calling encoding jobs. (todo once kprocess gets that feature)
Multiple Artists for 1 album.
Add the ability to encode files.
Rip and encode only 1 song at a time. (i.e. what the audioslave does now, but with a gui).
Plugin system for encoders (user friendly thingys)
