Change regexp infro to say that it is modifing the track names, not filename.

Add option to disable message box

Rip & Encode one track at a time."?
Maybe even better is "maximum uncoded wav's" with a number field as grip has
it (www.nostatic.org/grip).

Good point, however I would prefer the dialog again on a manual query and not after startup or switching a cd.

Add the ability to encode files.

Rip and encode only 1 track at a time. (i.e. using audiocd:/ ioslave).
Plugin system for encoders (user friendly things, again use audiocd plugin system)

If possible restart jobs that have failed.
