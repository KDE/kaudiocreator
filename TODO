BUG? encoding with different genre's
Multiple Artists for 1 album.
Add the ability to encode files.
Rip and encode only 1 song at a time. (i.e. what the audioslave does now, but with a gui).
Plugin system for encoders (user friendly thingys)
Use KURL relativePath() function rather then selfmade one.
Look into using QQue rather then the timer thing...

If possible restart jobs that have failed.
