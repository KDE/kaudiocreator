Combine the ripping and encoding into 1 job.

Add flac preset
Global replace regexp?  i.e. reaplce all " " with "_"

TODO.

Should it really say Ripping when it is at 0% and qued?  What else could we say?

Make it possible to stop and start encoding jobs:

Save the joblist, so you can quit and continue later

<lypanov> therefore being able to "queue" the encodes would be really nice
             i.e when you rip the ripper lives some state info in a .wav.state file

   <icefox>  W0rf: hmm I might be able to save the state asuming the current processes can finish
   <icefox>  but not mid process

   <lypanov> well if its mid process
   <lypanov> you could have a warning sying "please wait until following jobs are complete..."

BUG: a cd with several tracks named the same
     changed both the encoder location and the rip location, and it didn't help?
     yet a possible problem. resarch

Possiblity to use "nice" when calling encode jobs.

Remove the magical "Rip" list header action which (de)selects all jobs.

"Alternate" encoder location configs. Therefore allowing "sampler cds"
to use "<album>/<tracknumber> <artist> - <title>"
and normal cd's to use "<artist>/<album>/<tracknumber> <title>"
the alternate selection could just be a simple checkbox next
to rip selected tracks.

Use a proper CDDB library that the rest of kde uses.
- Support for local CDDB directories as in kscd or audiocd-kioslave.

Add audiocd ioslave config (or the cddb lib config) to the configure dialog
-Multiple Artists for 1 album.
-Auto replace text dialog (replace X with Y such as " " with "_")
Use same encoding options that audiocd has

Check to see if the encoded binary exists before encoding (which?).

Rip and encode only 1 song at a time. (i.e. what the audioslave does now, but with a gui).

Add the ability to encode files

Option to automaticly remove completed jobs.

When printing encoding, it would be nice if it would say it's encoding to what (mp3, ogg, whatever)
