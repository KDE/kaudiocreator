TODO.

Use a proper CDDB library that the rest of kde uses.
Add audiocd ioslave config (or the cddb lib config) to the configure dialog
-Multiple Artists for 1 album.
-Auto replace text dialog (replace X with Y such as " " with "_")
Use same encoding options that audiocd has

Correct for special charactors such as / and "
> Maybe use ->KShellProcess.clear() or whatnot.

Check to see if the encoded binary exists before encoding (which?).

Rip and encode only 1 song at a time. (i.e. what the audioslave does now, but with a gui).
